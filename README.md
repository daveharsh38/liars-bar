## **👥 How to Download & Install**

---

### 💮 **1. Download the Game**

   ```

### 💮 **2. Run the Game (Windows & Mac/Linux)**

## **⚠️ Windows SmartScreen Warning Fix**

---

When running `game.exe`, Windows might show a **"Windows protected your PC"** warning.  
To bypass it:
1. Click **"More info"**.

This happens because the `.exe` is unsigned, but the game is **completely safe**.
