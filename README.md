## **👥 How to Download & Install**

---

### 💮 **1. Download the Game**
1. Click the **"Code"** button (🟩 Green) on GitHub.
2. Select **"Download ZIP"** and extract it.
3. Alternatively, clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/daveharsh38/liars-bar.git
   cd liars-bar
   ```

### 💮 **2. Run the Game (Windows & Mac/Linux)**

---

#### **Windows:**

## **⚠️ Windows SmartScreen Warning Fix**

---

When running `liars-bar.exe`, Windows might show a **"Windows protected your PC"** warning.  
To bypass it:
1. Click **"More info"**.
2. Click **"Run Anyway"**.

This happens because the `.exe` is unsigned, but the game is **completely safe**.

2. Each player takes turns selecting cards.
3. Players can **bluff** or **challenge a previous move**.
4. If a player is caught lying, they **fire a pistol** (elimination system).
5. The last player standing **wins the game**! 🎉
